My godot learning code learnt using 'Godot Engine Game Development Projects: Build five cross-platform 2D and 3D games with Godot 3.0' book but translated into c#<br>
Asset files can be found here https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Godot-Game-Engine-Projects/tree/master<br>

NOTE⚠️:This project will be abandoned as it is not feasible to create a game with C# and godot due to limited learning resource material
